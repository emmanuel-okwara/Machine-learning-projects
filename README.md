Machine learning models

$ Hi There my name is emmanuel and this is
 the machine learning repository for some of the 
ML(MACHINE LEARNING MODELS) that i have built in python.

# With the help of www.kaggle.com | and online mL community. 
I was able to learn the basics of machine learning, enough to build my own model for competitions.

#If you are every interested check them out.
#Feed back on the code will be taken into consideration.

#Thank you.â­•ðŸ”¼
